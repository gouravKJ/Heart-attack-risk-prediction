📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
This project aims to assist in early risk assessment by analyzing health indicators such as cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, and lifestyle habits.
The model is trained on historical data and deployed to allow users to input their health details and receive an instant Low Risk / High Risk prediction.

🚀 Features
🔍 Predicts heart attack risk using machine learning
🧠 Uses a trained Logistic Regression model
📊 Displays risk probability along with classification
☁️ Deployed on Streamlit Cloud
⚡ Real-time predictions without retraining

🧪 Input Parameters
The application takes the following inputs:
### Feature	Description
Cholesterol	Serum cholesterol level (mg/dL)
Systolic BP	Upper blood pressure value
Diastolic BP	Lower blood pressure value
Heart Rate	Beats per minute
Diabetes	Yes / No
Smoking	Yes / No
Obesity	Yes / No
BMI	Body Mass Index

🎯 Output
Low Risk or High Risk of heart attack
Probability score indicating prediction confidence
